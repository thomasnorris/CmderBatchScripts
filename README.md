# Notes
- These batch scripts belong in the `personal\batch scripts` folder of Cmder.
- The folder above is included with the config zip file that is uploaded to Dropbox.
- Any scripts that are not in the `Portable` folder will not work properly unless run via Cmder itself.
  - In other words, only download and run the `Portable` scripts. This will get everything configured properly on a new computer.
  - The scripts that are **not** in the `Portable` folder are only in this repository for the sake of Version Control.
