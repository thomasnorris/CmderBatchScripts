# Notes
- These batch scripts belong in the `personal\batch scripts` folder of Cmder.
- The folder above is included with the config zip file that is uploaded to Dropbox.
- Scripts outside of the `Portable` folder are not to be used outside of Cmder itself
  - Download the `Portable` folder to get Cmder up and running on a new machine
  - A `DropboxLink.txt` file is required. This file contains the shared Dropbox link where the configs are stored
    - Probably stored in Google Drive somewhere
- The newest changes on the `master` branch will always be downloaded and applied from Cmder
